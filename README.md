I love technology and how it makes human life easier. As my contribution towards leaving this planet in a better shape, I leverage latest and the greatest in the tech world to support the commercial operations at Delta Air Lines. In my current role, I build AI vision, design and implement (first-ever) audience segmentation models to support marketing campaigns of the airline.
